# Advent of Code 2021

## Run all Solutions

```sh
ruby main.rb
```

## Run a Single Solution

```sh
cd solutions/DAY
ruby main.rb
```

**NOTE**: Some solutions have test cases you can also run with `ruby test.rb`

## Generate a New Solution Directory

```sh
sh new.sh
```

**NOTE**: This also changes directory to the new solution directory.
